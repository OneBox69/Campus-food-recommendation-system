"A stylized vertical animation, 9:16, 10 seconds.
Inside a quiet studio at night, a faceless artist figure made of soft light shapes sits at a desk surrounded by sketches and floating notes. The scene feels calm and dreamlike. As the room hums with gentle energy, the papers on the desk begin to glow and rise, forming abstract outlines of new worlds. The camera glides upward, following these luminous lines as they merge into drifting galaxies of color and motion.

CLIP: 1 (video_index 1)

CHARACTER (≈300 chars)

Nerida Quell — Female 32 + sinewy, bronzed skin with salt tint, undercut braid sea-black with teal + storm-gray eyes steady, a former lighthouse keeper turned night salvage diver chasing wreck-voices, driven by guilt, oilskin slick with spray under foghorn dusk, voice rough + warm holding suspense + brine breath.

WORLD / SETTING (≈800 chars)

Neon-lit analytics morgue. Stainless tables shimmer under cyan strips. Monitors hum with cold dashboards marked D2 retention. A translucent sheet covers a digital “body”—a dashboard grid faintly pulsing. Evidence trays hold printouts and devices tagged “time of death.” Off-screen, data drips like saline. The tone: forensic noir, analytic dread. Nerida enters through mist, flashlight glinting off chrome and condensation. We begin tight on the toe tag that reads “Retention.”

BEAT SCRIPT (≈1 500 chars)

0–2 s : Hook—close-up on toe tag reading “Retention D2,” flicker of chart flatline across it; Nerida: “No heartbeat since Tuesday noon.”

2–5 s : Build—she peels back the sheet; underneath, line charts pulse faintly like EKGs reconnecting. She traces dip points like veins. “Looks like oxygen left the funnel.”

5–8 s : Twist—UV mode reveals faint timezone stamps misaligned by one hour; a clue glowing like blood spatter. Her breath catches: “Not a dropout… a mis-sync.”

8–10 s : Lead—She snaps a photo on tablet; faint glitch reveals a missing playback segment. “We’ll need reconstruction.” Loop trigger: the misaligned timestamps briefly form the number 404.

CINEMATIC CRAFT (≈900 chars)

Lens: 40mm macro probe for toe-tag intro; gliding dolly to reveal chart pulse. Lighting: neon cyan top-strip, soft magenta fill. Movement: slow tracking foot-to-face cut; UV flicker strobe on reveal. Post: cool contrast, microfilm grain overlay; subtle distortion when timestamps align. Audio: low heartbeat bass, UV hum, breath texture. Signature transition: UV flicker dissolves into a clean gradient of cyan→dark teal for safe blend.

CHARACTER (≈300 chars)

Aiden Frost — Male 27 + tall + wiry, pale silver-toned skin, messy black hair streaked cobalt + icy blue eyes; a street illusionist turned fugitive driven by regret + clever defiance, trench coat dripping stormlight + coin flipping through guilt. Filmed under rain-slick neon, voice low + measured, confidence fractured by memory.

WORLD / SETTING (≈800 chars)

Match in from prior cyan→teal gradient into a metallic workstation bathed in analytical glow. On screen: corrupted session logs scrolling like ECG signals. Aiden stands, half-lit by blue panel light. The hum of servers feels like rainfall against steel. His expression: restrained urgency, a magician solving data murder under floodlight stillness. Evidence of timezone drift and OAuth fragments line the table. He begins spooling wire into data forms.

BEAT SCRIPT (≈1 500 chars)

0–2 s : Transition—cyan glow resolves into monitors; Aiden flips a coin onto log printouts: “Let’s unmake the trick.”

2–5 s : Build—he scrubs through video chunks; every fifth frame collapses to black. “Session bleed… maybe packet loss?” Coil of replays shows ghosts of clicks.

5–8 s : Twist—on magnify, reveals an OAuth token mismatch timestamped exactly one hour apart. “The drift matches your clue.” He breathes shallow; math overlays flash.

8–10 s : Lead—He drags fragments into a temporal map, half-lit grin. “Initiating reconstruction.” Loop trigger: the coin spins endlessly just before darkness, edge glint flickering like a spinning cursor.

CINEMATIC CRAFT (≈900 chars)

Lens: 28mm handheld macro zoom between faces and screens. Movement: subtle push-in through coin spin; micro-jitters mimic data lag. Lighting: cool neon + neutral fill, zero flare. Texture: misty condensation on lens border. Audio: metallic coin roll, low magnetic hum, faint heartbeat reverb. Signature transition: spin blur dissolving to neutral gray gradient with teal pulse on centerline.

WORLD / SETTING (≈800 chars)

Open on spin-blur gradient resolving into a calm morgue table: both monitors now sync in perfect tempo. Reconstructed replay runs fluidly across giant display. The neon hue softens from forensic chill to dawn blue. Aiden’s coin rests flat beside evidence tray. Nerida watches the timeline replay as heartbeat arches return. Tone pivots from investigation to eerie closure—a death rewritten.

BEAT SCRIPT (≈1 500 chars)

0–2 s : Hook—heartbeat graph resumes; glow flows across Nerida’s face. “He’s breathing again.”

2–5 s : Build—session timeline weaves through reconstructed frames; every cursor click aligns neatly. She overlays the word ‘alive’ across chart cutlines.

5–8 s : Twist—the final few frames replay a hidden Slack alert timestamped exactly at original death minute. “It looped you to before failure.”

8–10 s : Payoff—she exhales, monitors fade into sunrise wash; charts stabilize. “Churn solved, case closed.” Loop trigger: brief echo of heartbeat sound creates rewatch itch.
